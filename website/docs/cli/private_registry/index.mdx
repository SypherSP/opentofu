# Private Registries

OpenTofu, by default, uses the public registry at [registry.opentofu.org](https://opentofu.org/registry/). 
However, organizations may have a need for a private registry for modules, providers, or policies that need to be kept private.

There are several project that implement the [terraform registry API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs), 
aimed at providing this functionality of hosting a private registry. They are also
compatible with OpenTofu. Some of the projects only support providers, some only support modules, and some support both. 
Choose one that is appropriate for your use case.
