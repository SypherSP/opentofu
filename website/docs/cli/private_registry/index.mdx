# Private Registries

OpenTofu, by default, uses the public registry at [registry.opentofu.org](https://opentofu.org/registry/). 
However, organizations may have a need for a private registry for modules, providers, or policies that need to be kept private.

There are several project that implement the [terraform registry API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs), 
aimed at providing this functionality of hosting a private registry. They are also
compatible with OpenTofu.
